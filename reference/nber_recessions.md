the National Bureau of Economic Research, from the contraction that

## Details

The NBER dates turning points to a month, not a day. Each date here is
the first day of the dated month: `peak` is the last month of the
expansion and `trough` the last month of the contraction, which is the
convention behind the shaded bands on FRED's own charts.

The table is a static copy, so a newly dated recession will not appear
until the package is updated.
[`fred_recessions()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/fred_recessions.md)
reads the same turning points live from FRED and is the one to use if
that matters.
