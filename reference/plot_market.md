# Draw a market outcome

The demand curve, the industry marginal-cost curve (marginal cost at
each firm's share of the quantity), marginal revenue where it matters,
the outcome, and the welfare areas: consumer surplus above the price,
producer surplus between the price and marginal cost, and the
deadweight-loss triangle between the outcome and the efficient quantity.

## Usage

``` r
plot_market(
  outcome,
  q_max = NULL,
  shade = c("cs", "ps", "dwl"),
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL,
  source = NULL,
  panel = "blue"
)
```

## Arguments

- outcome:

  A `market_outcome` from
  [`monopoly()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/market_structure.md),
  [`cournot()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/market_structure.md),
  [`perfect_competition()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/market_structure.md)
  or
  [`first_degree()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/price_discrimination.md).
  For first-degree discrimination the whole area between demand and
  marginal cost is shaded as producer surplus, since that is who gets
  it.

- q_max:

  Right-hand limit of the quantity axis. Defaults to the demand curve's
  `q_max`.

- shade:

  Which areas to shade: any of `"cs"`, `"ps"`, `"dwl"`.

- title, subtitle, source:

  Passed to
  [`labs_econ()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/labs_econ.md);
  sensible defaults are filled in.

- panel:

  Passed to
  [`theme_econ()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/theme_econ.md).

## Value

A ggplot object. Add
[`econ_masthead()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/econ_masthead.md)
last if you want the block.

## Examples

``` r
d <- linear_demand(intercept = 100, slope = 1)
plot_market(monopoly(d, quadratic_cost(a = 20)))

plot_market(cournot(d, quadratic_cost(a = 20), n = 3))

plot_market(perfect_competition(d, quadratic_cost(fixed = 100, a = 20, b = 1)))
```
