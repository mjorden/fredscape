# Shade recession bands behind a time series

Returns a rectangle annotation spanning the full height of the panel for
each recession, to be added before the data layers so the shading sits
underneath them.

## Usage

``` r
annotate_recessions(
  data = nber_recessions,
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  fill = "#8FA5B0",
  alpha = 0.35
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame of recession intervals with `peak` and `trough` date
  columns. Defaults to
  [nber_recessions](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/nber_recessions.md);
  pass the result of
  [`fred_recessions()`](https://mjorden.github.io/fredscape/reference/fred_recessions.md)
  for a live copy.

- from, to:

  Optional window. Recessions that do not overlap it are dropped, which
  keeps the x-axis from stretching back to 1857 when the series starts
  in 1990.

- fill:

  Band colour.

- alpha:

  Band opacity.

## Value

A ggplot2 annotation layer, or a zero-row layer if nothing overlaps the
window.

## Examples

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(economics, aes(date, uempmed)) +
  annotate_recessions(from = min(economics$date), to = max(economics$date)) +
  geom_line(colour = econ_colours("blue"), linewidth = 0.7) +
  scale_x_econ_date() +
  scale_y_econ() +
  labs_econ(
    title = "The long wait",
    subtitle = "United States, median duration of unemployment, weeks",
    note = "Shaded areas are NBER-dated recessions",
    source = "FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis"
  ) +
  theme_econ()
```
