#' US recession dates from the NBER
#'
#' Peak and trough months of every US business cycle contraction dated by the
#' National Bureau of Economic Research, from the contraction that began in
#' June 1857 to the one that began in February 2020.
#'
#' The NBER dates turning points to a month, not a day. Each date here is the
#' first day of the dated month: `peak` is the last month of the expansion and
#' `trough` the last month of the contraction, which is the convention behind
#' the shaded bands on FRED's own charts.
#'
#' The table is a static copy, so a newly dated recession will not appear until
#' the package is updated. [fred_recessions()] reads the same turning points
#' live from FRED and is the one to use if that matters.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 34 rows and 3 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{peak}{`Date`. First day of the peak month.}
#'   \item{trough}{`Date`. First day of the trough month.}
#'   \item{months}{`integer`. Approximate length of the contraction.}
#' }

"nber_recessions"

#' Shade recession bands behind a time series
#'
#' Returns a rectangle annotation spanning the full height of the panel for
#' each recession, to be added before the data layers so the shading sits
#' underneath them.
#'
#' @param data A data frame of recession intervals with `peak` and `trough`
#'   date columns. Defaults to [nber_recessions]; pass the result of
#'   [fred_recessions()] for a live copy.
#' @param from,to Optional window. Recessions that do not overlap it are
#'   dropped, which keeps the x-axis from stretching back to 1857 when the
#'   series starts in 1990.
#' @param fill Band colour.
#' @param alpha Band opacity.
#'
#' @return A ggplot2 annotation layer, or a zero-row layer if nothing overlaps
#'   the window.

#' Fetch recession dates live from FRED
